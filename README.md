# Reverse Vowels of a String

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, reverse **only** all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`. They can appear in both **lowercase** and **uppercase**, and they may appear more than once in the string.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`s = "IceCreAm"`  
**Output:**  
`"AceCreIm"`  

**Explanation:**  
The vowels in `s` are `['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']`.  
On reversing the vowels, the string becomes `"AceCreIm"`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`s = "leetcode"`  
**Output:**  
`"leotcede"`  

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10⁵`
- `s` consists of printable ASCII characters.
